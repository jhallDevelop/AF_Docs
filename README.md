## Usage

After installation and building the project:

### Convert Markdown to HTML

```
./bin/AF_Docs [input_directory] [output_directory]
```

**Examples:**

```
# Use default directories (./docs ‚Üí ./bin/public)
./bin/AF_Docs

# Custom directories
./bin/AF_Docs ./my-docs ./website

# Show help
./bin/AF_Docs --help
```

### Preview Your Site

```
cd bin/public
../AF_HTTP
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:8080`

**Key directory structure:**

*   `docs/` - Default input directory for markdown files
*   `bin/public/` - Default output directory for HTML files
*   `bin/AF_Docs` - Markdown converter binary
*   `bin/AF_HTTP` - HTTP preview server binary

## FAQ ‚ùì

**"I get compilation errors when running** `**make**`**"**

*   **Check GCC version:** Ensure you have a modern GCC compiler installed (`gcc --version`)
*   **Missing headers:** Verify that standard C libraries are installed
*   **Submodules:** Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to fetch dependencies

**"The converter doesn't find my markdown files"**

*   **Check file extensions:** Only `.md` files are processed
*   **Verify path:** Ensure the input directory path is correct and contains markdown files
*   **Permissions:** Check that the program has read access to the input directory

**"AF\_HTTP shows 404 errors"**

*   **Run from correct directory:** AF\_HTTP serves files from the current directory
*   **Check file paths:** Ensure HTML files exist in the directory you're serving
*   **CSS paths:** Verify that `markdown.css` is in the correct location relative to HTML files
